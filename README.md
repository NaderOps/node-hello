## üöÄ Overview
The project demonstrates:
- Containerization of a simple Node.js application.
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for linting, building, and pushing a Docker image.
- Deployment with Terraform.
- Integration with New Relic for log forwarding.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure
- `Dockerfile` ‚Äì Multi-stage Docker build for optimized image size.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` ‚Äì GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.
- `terraform/` ‚Äì Terraform configuration for deploying the app and New Relic agent.
- `.gitignore` ‚Äì Common ignores for Node.js, Terraform, and Docker.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features Implemented
1. **Application Setup**
   - Added a linting package (`eslint`) with a script for code quality checks.
   - Modified the Node.js app to:
     - Listen on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).
     - Print an extra log message for New Relic log forwarding.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**
   - Runs linting on every push/PR.
   - Builds the Docker image.
   - Pushes the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., GitHub Container Registry).

3. **Deployment (Terraform)**
   - Deploys the application container.
   - Uses Terraform with the Docker provider.
   - Deploys the New Relic Infrastructure Agent to collect and forward logs.

4. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - New Relic Infrastructure agent forwards application logs for visibility.

## üåê Deployment with Terraform
1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
    export TF_VAR_newrelic_license_key="YOUR_NEW_RELIC_KEY"
    export TF_VAR_dockerhub_username="YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME"
    export TF_VAR_dockerhub_password="YOUR_DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD"
   ```

3. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   This will:
   - Deploy the app container (from public ghcr).
   - Deploy the New Relic Infrastructure Agent (dockerhub).
